Parameter: MEASURE

Explanation:
  You can specify the number of measures for each track. When recording along with rhythm sounds or other tracks, it’s
  convenient to specify the number of measures before you record, so that looping will occur at the specified measure
  length, even if you don’t operate the switch when you’ve finished recording.

  (*) This parameter is available only if LOOP.S (p. 3) is "ON".

Details:
  - Value: AUTO
    Detail:
      Tracks that are set to AUTO will have the same number of measures. The number of
      measures is determined by the first-recorded track of the tracks that are set to AUTO.
      For example, if all tracks are set to AUTO, the value set as the number of measures for the
      second and subsequent tracks will be identical to the number of measures in the first track
      that was recorded.

  - Value: FREE
    Default: True
    Detail:
      The number of measures will be set automatically, corresponding to the length of the
      recording.

  - Value: 1MEAS-
    Detail:
      The number of measures will be set manually.

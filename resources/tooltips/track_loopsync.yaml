Parameter: LOOP SYNC

Explanation:
  Specifies whether the beginning of the track 1 and track 2 phrases are aligned for loop
  playback (ON), or whether they loop-play at the length of their respective phrases (OFF).

  (*) When REVERSE is set to “ON,” you won’t be able to switch to overdubbing after a recording
  has been completed.

  If you turn LOOP.S on, the beginning of the tracks will always be aligned. This means that if
  tracks are already playing back, the playback start location of the other tracks will become
  “the current location of the phrase being played.”The following illustration is an example
  of how playback will occur with track 1 and 2 that contain the identical melody but have
  different loop sync settings.

Parameter: QUANTIZE

Explanation:
    "With tracks for which LOOP.S (p. 3) is “ON,” under any of the conditions listed below, your timing will be corrected
      (Loop Quantize) based on the tempo and time signature of the rhythm, even if the timing at which you press a button is slightly inaccurate.
    <ul>
      <li>If the rhythm is on</li>
      <li>If there is an already-recorded track whose LOOP.S is turned on</li>
      <li>If the MIDI Sync is on</li>
    </ul>
     <br> * The QUANTIZE setting applies only during recording. It is ignored during overdubbing or playback.
     <br> * When you stop recording, it is quantized to match the measure length of the previously-recorded track (LOOP.S: ON) or
      rhythm."

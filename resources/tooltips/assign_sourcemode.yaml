Parameter: SRC MODE

Explanation:
  If a momentary-type footswitch (such as the separately sold FS-5U) is connected as the source, you can specify how
  footswitch operations will affect the value.

Details:
  - Value: MOMENT
    Detail:
      The setting will normally be off (minimum value); it will be on (maximum value) only while you
      continue holding down the footswitch.

  - Value: TOGGLE
    Detail:
      The setting will alternate between off (minimum value) and on (maximum value) each time you
      press the footswitch.

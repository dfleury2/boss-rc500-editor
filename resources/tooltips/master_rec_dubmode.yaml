Parameter: DUB MODE

Explanation:
  Specifies the overdubbing method.

Details:
  - Value: OVERDUB
    Default: True
    Detail:
      The new performance is layered onto the prerecorded tracks.
      <br>If overdubbing is repeated, the next performance is layered on top of the previous material,
      allowing you to create an ensemble in a single track.

  - Value: REPLACE
    Detail:
      Tracks with existing recordings are overwritten as new tracks are recorded over them.
      <br>Overwriting takes places while the previously recorded tracks are played back, allowing you
      to achieve a kind of delay effect similar to that obtained from an effects processor.
